# Customer Insights with Power BI: An E-commerce ETL Project

## Project Overview:
This is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project with Amazon S3, SnowFlake and Power BI. Project goals are:
  * Developing a customer-centric dashboard using Power BI to monitor and analyze customer data from an e-commerce platform.  The goal is to create actionable insights that enhance business decision-making by providing a comprehensive view of customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and sales trends.
  * Extracting data stored in an S3 bucket on AWS, transforming it within Snowflake, and loading it into Power BI for visualization.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project consists of 286,392 entries across 36 columns, capturing detailed information about orders placed by customers on the e-commerce website. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical data, such as:

Numerical Data: Item ID, quantity ordered, price, value, discount amount, total, customer ID, year, reference number, age, zip code, and discount percentage.
Categorical Data: Order ID, order date, and order status.
This dataset is ideal for analyzing purchasing patterns, identifying popular products, and understanding customer behavior. It also supports the development of predictive models for forecasting customer behavior and sales trends.
